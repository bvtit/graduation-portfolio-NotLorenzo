   <p>Objective: The student must fully design a complex network using skills and configure a PROTOTYPE. <br />
A company needs a network to be designed and implemented; the company has locations in four cities. All of the locations will be connected using leased-line (T1) serial links. The company has previously used RIP version 2; however, a default static route must be used and distributed to allow access to the internet.
One location, Cork, has a large and complex LAN. Due to the size and complexity, the company wants to create VLANs to control broadcasts, enhance security, and logically group users. The company also wants to use private addresses throughout the Autonomous System, DHCP over most of the LAN segments, Static and Dynamic NAT implemented for Internet connectivity. The company also wishes to limit access to some LAN segments within the network.
Although private addresses (RFC 1918) will be used, the company appreciates efficiency and address conservation in the design. To minimize wasted address space, they have requested VLSM to be used when appropriate.</p>
